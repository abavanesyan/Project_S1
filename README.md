# Project_S1
# Computer Manufacturing Control Project
This project is a C programming endeavor focused on digital manufacturing control, with a specific emphasis on the analysis of computer Random Access Memory (RAM) sales data. The primary goal is to implement statistical analysis, optimize the manufacturing process, and provide insights into RAM market trends.

# Key Features
Statistical Analysis: Utilizes C programming for statistical calculations, including mean, variance, standard deviation, and more.

Data Structures: Implements efficient binary tree structures for organizing and managing RAM sales data.

Binomial Distribution: Simulates the binomial distribution to estimate the probability of defects in the RAM manufacturing process.

Real-time Insights: Enables data-driven decision-making for manufacturers by offering insights into market trends and popular product configurations.

# Project Components
Project_Main.c: Contains the main function and file I/O operations.
Project_1.h: Houses functions for statistical analysis, data structures, and the binomial distribution.

# Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have a C compiler (e.g., clang) installed on your system.

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/abavanesyan/Project_S1

Navigate to the project directory:
cd Project_S1

Compile the code:
clang Project_Main.c -lm (-lm is for math.h header file)

# Usage
Run the compiled executable:
./a.out
The results will be saved in the project_output.txt file.

# Testing
The project includes a testing section in the main function, using simulated data to validate the functionality of implemented algorithms.
